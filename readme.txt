This software is a prototype for the iPhone app "FH2Go for iOS". It is the counterpart to the app by Markus Deutsch called "FH2Go", which is for Andoid.
Nowadays nearly everyone, and escpecially students, have a smartphone with them all the time. 
These smartphones have access to the Internet at every possible time, even if no computer is near.
The website of the FH JOANNEUM therefore can always be accessed.
This leads to the problem, that smartphones have a far smaller display than computer monitors.
Therefore the display of the website is very small and nearly unreadable.
This prototype solves the problem of the unreadable screen and simplifies the access for the students to view the schedule, the grades and exams, and the RSS-news of the FH JOANNEUM.
It fetches the data from the server using FHPI (https://ws.fh-joanneum.at)
